# Starting from SCORM: A Developerâ€™s Guide
  
  
  
This project was first presented at the ADL xAPI Bootcamp in Alexandria, VA in 2015. It is now being maintained here to allow others to access this workshop. If you are interested in try the code tutorial, refer to the steps in the [Instructions] (https://github.com/adlnet/Starting-from-SCORM-A-Developers-Guide/blob/master/Instructions.md).

#### Session description
This session will provide an overview of the [SCORM to TLA Roadmap](http://adlnet.github.io/SCORM-to-TLA-Roadmap/).  The roadmap is a phased approach detailing the means to update traditional SCORM content to Experience API (xAPI) (and additional Web services).

* Participants will update an existing SCORM course using the SCORM to xAPI Wrapper.  
* After integration with the original SCORM course, the wrapper tracks SCORM-like data via xAPI statements.  
* After integration, an [xAPI statement viewer](http://adlnet.github.io/xapi-statement-viewer/) will be used to examine data stored by the content.

Time permitting, an Android app which augments data saved by the SCORM course will be demonstrated.

#### Prerequisites 
* Familiarity with Web programming including HTML and JavaScript
* Some experience with SCORM a plus, but not mandatory

#### What to bring with you
Participants should come with a laptop and a code editor.  If you are installing an editor for this session, consider [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/), as it will be used as the demonstration IDE.  

To (optionally) test your course along the way in an LMS, please come with an account to an existing SCORM Conformant LMS (3rd or 4th Ed) account.  If you do not have an existing LMS account, consider using a hosted solution: [SCORM Cloud](http://cloud.scorm.com).  More advanced users may install a local LMS: [ADL Sample RTE](http://www.adlnet.org/resources/scorm-2004-4th-edition-adl-sample-rte-version-1_1_1/index.html).
